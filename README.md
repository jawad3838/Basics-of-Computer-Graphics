# Basics-of-Computer-Graphics
This repository includes various projects that will help you understand the basic concepts of computer graphics such as transformations, animations, texturing, model-view matrix and more.

## Pre-requisites
We will be using WebGL graphics pipeline to create these programs. An overview of the pipeline is shown below:

![WebGL Pipelinegit](https://github.com/jawad3838/Basics-of-Computer-Graphics/blob/master/webgl-pipeline.png)

The lib folder must be included in the root folder as it contains the necessary libraries needed for all programs to work. Include that in the parent directory where all the individual programs are placed.

## Projects

### Dots on screen using mouse Event
This program tell us the basics of the WebGL pipeline such as passing values to the vertex and fragment shaders and handling mouse events.

### Draw Quad/Triangle with colors
This program tells us the basics of passing colors to fragments that make up a particular shape.

### Rotating objects
This program covers the basics of using the model-view matrix and basic transformations (such as translation, rotation)
